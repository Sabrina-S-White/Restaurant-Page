I'm going to do the following to finish this project: 
    1. Create three separate js modules for the tabs. 
    2. Remove all 'home' content from pgLoad.js - this will go to the home module. 
        - Then create the div that content goes into. This currently isn't created but should have the class names of 'bg' and 'main'. 
    3. Create function in index.js that listens to each button. Try using jquery? 
        - This will erase everything in the 'main' div and then run the module corresponding to the button clicked. 
    4. Set it up to run on github pages.
